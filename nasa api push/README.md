# My Awesome Project
A cool website to view daily nasa images. 

**Link to project:** https://dailynasaimages.netlify.app

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 

Used NASA's API and built a website around it to be able to display the images, date the image was taken and a description about the image. I also made it so that you can choose a date other than today and see images from those days as well!

## Optimizations

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about how API's work as well as how to implement them in order to receive the data back to display in a browser. 

## Examples:
